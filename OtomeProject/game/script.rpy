    g "How dare you even speak with me, you filth! Did you even do so much as take a look at yourself? You’re fat plus ugly! Ugh, you just plain disgust me. Try better, creep."

    g "Ciao, Fatty. Good luck with your ugly, miserable and loveless life. Hahahahaha!"

    n "What did I do to deserve this? This is the ump teenth time I’ve been rejected. This time, they’re giving me the nickname ‘Fatty’? (sighs) What a day..
     I gave up on searching for someone who could possibly love a joke like me. Just f*ck love, man. I’ll always be alone, no matter what."

    #scene one
    m "Hey… Hey you! You over there! You sorry sap of a man who just got rejected!"
    "(taken aback)"
    n "Wha-- what do you want? Wait, who even are you?! What's up with the mask, bro? To hide an ugliness like the one I have? Oh boy, if that’s the case, I 	wish I had a mask just like that."
    m "What, my mask? Oh no no no, my good man -- it’s not to hide any ol’ ugliness. Why would a charming, lavishing young man such as myself need to hide some non-existent hideousness? What I’m hiding is… (whispers) Come closer."

    "Nami leans closer to the masked stranger."
    m "… Fame. Hehehehe."
    n "… What."
    m "Wherever I go, the mask stays with me. Just like a river with a turtle."
    n "What you just said makes no sense--"
    "(delighted grin)"
    m "Even my mom approved of it too!"
    n "Okay, you know what? Just stay away from me, man. I’m already having a bad day. I just got rejected by yet another girl so I’ve got no time for your jargon."
    m "Awww, you just got rejected? C’mon, being fat is not the worst. You’re all kinds of chubby, and that’s considered cute to some people. Have an optimistic outlook, man. Besides, didn’t you hear of that old wife’s tale? ‘There are plenty of fish in the sea’!"
    n "Just shut up, man. And plus, that’s an idiom, not some old wife’s tale."
    m "Hey hey hey. Whoaaaa, man. Okay, I’m going to tell you a lil’ secret. Y’know, a bro-to-bro kind of secret. Lean closer, I’ll tell you what it is: (whispers) I know someone who’s gonna accept you, regardless of who you are."
    "(surprised)"
    n "What? You know a girl?"
    m "Nahhh, hahaha! Didn’t we already establish that no sane girl wants you?"
    n "(disappointed) Oh."
    m "I’m talking about a group, a society. A holy matrimony of the greatest chaps who don’t care about money. It’s the…"
    "Drum roll plays in the background."
    m "Japanese Cultural Society! (fanfares play in the background) Or JCS for short."
    n "The JCS? What? You mean that loser get-together community where unwanted virgins flock together to swoon over 2D girls that talk like a yelping penguin? That shadowed group polluted by numbskulls people call ‘weebs’? I’m not interested in your club, bro. I’m desperate, but I’m not that desperate. Besides, do I even know who you are?"
    m "Oh c’mon, bro. We already got rejected like so many times. We need members too, so why not join the other rejects who are just like you? We could always use a new buddy in our ranks -- a fella to add to our family, y’know? Chillax, I’ll take you there and you’re gonna have a great time. Besides, there are ladies there too. Maybe one of them will, I dunno, finally feel bad for you and endure a date with you."
    n "You know what? At this point, I just don’t care about girls anymore. But (sighs) fine, you got me at ‘family’. Alright, masked weirdo, tell me more about the JCS. What do they even do for starters?"
    m "Ahahahaha, well well well. I knew you’d take the right step! To enlighten you, I’ll say that we proud members of the JCS has got a lot of goodies and surprise events we do centering on, well, Japanese culture! Some weeb bullsh*t, yeah, but not purely that. First off, we’ve got events we put our creative lil’ minds together to come up with: Japanese workshops and the upcoming JC Night, for example. We’ve also got trips and my favourite? The bonding camp, man. Hoooo boy, if that ain’t the best time to go fishing for hot chicks! My words impressing you, lover boy?"
    n "Hmmm, I guess there are a few trips that are grabbing my attention. Besides, I’ve already lost all hope in anything else I ever loved anyway so nothing worse can happen, I guess. (sighs) Alright, bro, let’s try out your little club and see if it’s worth any of my time."
    m "Ayyyyy, that’s the spirit, man! Oh boy, Aida’s gonna be so proud of me for fishing in more fresh blood, hehehehe! Well chump, you just made the right choice. Like, no kidding. So, you busy right now? Like, really busy?"
    n "Nah, not really, but I’m about to head over back and get some decent sleep actually--"
    m "Bahhhh, sleep is for the weak! Be a man, lover boy! Come with me and join us in our secret JCS lair."
    n "What?! But my precious sleep…! Masked man, nooooo….!"
    "And without further ado and ignoring his pleas, the masked man dragged Nami over to the secret JCS lair."
    n "(thinking to himself) What a weird boy. He gives me the creeps already. Oh damn, I can’t even imagine how weirder his club must be with him already being like this. Gah, never mind. Nothing is better than giving it a try, right? At least, I hope I gain a chance to find some long term friendship over there."
    #scene two
    m "Kocchi, kocchi! We’re close -- just a few steps more!"

    n "What (pants) floor are we (pants) in now? We at heaven or something? Oh God, I can’t even feel my legs."

    m "Ahhhh, here we are: the best spot in MMU! Or as we like to call it… Uhhhh, wait, what do we call it again? Let me think…"

    n "I… (breathes heavily) need… (breathes heavily) water…"

    m "Oh, don’t be such a wuss. Did you even think for a second that I could be dying because I’m wearing this darn mask? Be considerate, man, sheesh."
    "Aida rushes out to check out the noise."

    a "What’s up with all the noise? Who’s there?! …Oh, Mushi, it’s just you. How very early of you to be at our club at this time. Didn’t I already tell you to not come bothering us with your jibber-jabber?!"

    m "Oh chill up, Aida. I was just sauntering around, finding myself some chicks here and there until I found this poor lad being rejected for like, the bazillionth time.
    (leans closer to Aida and whispers) Believe it or not, this dude had it worse than me being rejected like that.
    It gave me hope that one day, some girl would choose me for the sake of avoiding a doofus like him!"

    n "(hits Mushi in the stomach)
    I heard that, jackass!"

    m "Ouch!"

    a "Hmmmm, I like you! You’re a man of strength and refined honour for teaching the masked phantom discipline. Come in, samurai -- we have a club to burn!"
    "Aida pushes both Nami and Mushi into the club room."

    a "Sooooo, this is basically our club room… for now. I know it’s filled with dust and whatnot all over the place but hey, it’s a nice spot for us JCS folks! (raises voice) Am I right?"

    m "Heck yeah, kaichou! Hontou ni subarashii~!"

    a"So… who is this? This is not some spot for you and your goons to lepak around, Mushi."

    m "Oh yeah, whoops, I forgot about you. Alright, fellas, meet… Hey, wait a sec,
     I don’t even know what’s your name. Hahaha, some moron I am. Alright alright, let’s trade. Ahem ahem.
      Watakushi no namae wa Mushi desu, or Mushi for short. Douzo yoroshiku onegaishimasu. (bows lowly to Nami) Anata no namae wa?"

    n "Uh… what?"

    He’s asking for your name."

    a "(interrupts; excited)
    Hi, my name is Aida! I’m the president of the JCS and this guy over here is Danny."

    n "Huh? Danny? I only see you and Mushi…"
    "Danny emerges from a table where he was hiding underneath."

    d "Yo, s’up? I’m Danny. Yoroshiku."

    n "What the f*ck? Hi, yoroshiblaghehwhut?"

    d "Ehh, close enough."

    n "Wait, so hold on. How many people are there in this club? Just the three of you? How is this club going to run with just the three of you? I expected more people -- maybe at least… twenty?"

    a "(offended)
    You got a problem with that?!"

    d "(meekly interrupts)
    Actually, we have four people in total. One of them isn’t here yet--"

    Um… Hi there. I’m Nami. Yogoshiwho."

    Hi, I’m Alis! I’m not really good with Japanese but hey, I’ll take that intro!"

    a "(slides into the conversation)
    Sooo, Nami. What brings you here? You interested in being one of us? (narrows eyes) You’re not just gonna leave, are ya?"

    m "(mutters)
    So he is…"

    a "(angry)
    Let him talk, Mushi! What do you think he is, some kind of mouthless man?!"

    m "(raises both hands in surrender)
    O-okay. Just rambling sh*t, jeez."


    n "Well, no, I’m not leaving yet but that doesn’t mean I’m joining either.
     What I want to know before I make that decision is… what exactly do you do in this club? Will it all be worth my time?"

    d "Ah shit, here we go again."

    a "(stares crossed at Mushi)
    Mushi, you just brought some random guy to this club without giving him all the details? You for real?"
    "Mushi remains silent but looks ahead with a derp face."

    a "(groans)
    I’ll get you for this. (looks at Nami) Alright, I’m only going to say this once,
    so get it stuck in your head. Our club here is about to be disbanded because as you can see, we are lacking members.
    In short, we need your help in getting it to grow so it won’t get disbanded. You ready for this challenge?"

    al "(cheers in the background)
    Yay, new members!"

    "Mushi continues staring off with a derp face."


    n "Mushi, need a little help here!"


    m"(sustained derp face)
    If I speak, she’ll kill me…"


    a"(intervenes)
    So are you up for the challenge or not?!"


    n"(panics; surprised)
    Ahh, okay okay! I’ll do this challenge. I mean, this will definitely work out if we put our heads together, right guys?"

    "Nami is met with silence."


    n"Um… guys?"

    "Nami looks over to Danny, Alis and Mushi, whom are all putting on the exact same derp face Mushi had earlier."

    n "(thinking to himself)
    Oh boy…"


    a "Good choice! Well team, now that we’ve added another number to our midsts,
    let’s begin our quest to find more people. We shall STRIVE! Nami,
    get over here and fill out this form."


    al "(cheerfully)
    We are soooo gonna party tonight!"


    m "Uhh, Aida?"


    d "Oh no, not again…"


    a "It’s our tradition! Masjid, here we come!"


    m "Hang on, you’re forgetting something, Aida: the best part!"


    a "Oh yeah… Considering I’m poor right now, we can’t go for an all-out karaoke party.
     Welp, if that’s the case, how about we take a rest over at the LP and gaze up at the beautiful stars over MMU?
      Oh, and don’t forget about Deen’s amazing butter chicken too!"

    Yes, finally. A more peaceful party."

     Let’s not waste our golden opportunity to form a nice, big family here!
      I’m sure you won’t be wasting a single second here."

    Yayyyyyyy~!"

    Make sure you do your work--"

    al "Nak ikut!"

    Kids these days… None of them know how to even appreciate money."

    Help… me…"

    "The five of them all leave over to a mamak store to enjoy their time out and welcome the new member of their club.
     After a whole night’s part, Nami returns to his hostel exhausted and beat."




    n "(thinking to himself)
    Damn, those guys are insane. They are without a single care in the world but…
    I have to admit they’re really funny. Heh.
    I hope I can be like them one day too. Anyway, now that I’ve got myself into this new club,
    let’s see if I can put in the best I can for it."

    ‘Hajime yo’? The fu--"



    a "All right, guys! This week is an important week.
     It’s the week where freshmen are gonna start pouring in by massive numbers and we need people!
      At the same time, I’ve got some good news: a senior from the club before us is gonna be having
      an event over at the MPH tonight called the ‘JC Night’."


    n "JC Night?"


    a "(angrily)
    Did I say you could talk, Nami?!"

    "Mushi, Alis and Nami nod slowly, plastered on their faces a classical derp face."


    a "(taken aback; surprised)
    What the eff, Mushi?! How long have you been there?"


    m "(pouting; saddened)
    S-since the very beginning. How did you not notice me? I’m sad now."


    al "Maybe if you weren’t putting on that ridiculous mask of yours, we’d
    notice you were there, like, right away. Am I right or am I right, Nami? (looks expectantly at Nami, waiting for his agreement)"


    m "(sadly)
    I know that, Alis, but… my mom wouldn’t let me do that."

    a "(interrupts)
    Didn’t I tell you all to stay quiet?!"

    "Mushi, Alis and Nami immediately returned to being silent."


    a "If I may continue, JC Night is a performance night with tons of people coming over to check out the talented performers.
     What kind of performance, you might ask? Since, like, the dawn of time, JC Night has performances involving acting,
      dancing, singing, fighting with… Japanese culture! "

    Hell yeah! Go go, Japanese culture!"

     of an outfit in front of me, you got that?! (sudden solemn face) Make sure to invite all your friends with you, else…"

    So, mind if I hang out with you guys during then--"

    Alright, who’s gonna be sitting beside me? Nami? Mushi? Aida? You three are coming right? Hehehehe!"

    What about me, guys…?"


    m "Well, sorry, guys. I can’t spend this clearly important event normally --
     I have to enjoy it with someone special, hehe. (speaks in a hushed tone) My mom."

    "Nami, Danny, Alis and Aida roll their eyes."


    n "(thinking to himself)
    JC Night, huh? So that means everyone is gonna be there… my crush included.
    If that’s the case, I’m definitely not missing this. Plus, I’m gonna be meeting a lot of new people
     as friends on the way. But who exactly should I invite with me? Alis? Mushi? Danny? Aida?"

    Ahahahah, I’m just joking lah. It’s more because the night itself is special. I mean, it only happens once every year, right?"

    Yeah… hahaha…"

    Ladies and gentlemen, gather round for in five minutes, we’re bringing this party to life!"

Most of all, a special thank you goes out to members and the high committee of the Japanese Cultural Society for backing me up for this event and really, having my back through thick and thin during times of hardship. Once again, thank you, and just enjoy the show!

    Uh, sure."

    Hooray! Well come on, then! This way!"

     After approximately fifteen minutes, Alis has led Nami into a quiet part of Cyberjaya."

    You know, it was just a coincidence that the JC Night for this year was on this particular night but…

    Where?"

     It takes her a while to start smiling but when she finally does,
      it was not long until she starts to laugh as well.
